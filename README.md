# AutomaticScaling

The plugin to automically scale entire UI's in just one click!
Ever hated how with some of the other scaling plugins you had to select each and every object? This plugin scales every descendant of a selected Gui Object!

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you only have Gui Objects selected when running this plugin to ensure you do not encounter any errors.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is in very early development, expect bugs, inperfect scaling, etc.
